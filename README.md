# Ras-Signaling
"Ras is a monomeric membrane-associated GTP-binding protein that regulates cell proliferation and survival in response to extracellular stimuli, such as activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of T cell receptor (TCR). Originally identified as an oncogene in murine sarcoma viruses, activating mutations in Ras have been found in about 30% of human tumors. Dysregulation of the Ras signaling pathway plays a key role in the progression of cancer. When bound to GTP, Ras is active and stimulates several downstream targets by direct interactions."
