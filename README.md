# Ras-Signaling
"Ras is a monomeric membrane-associated GTP-binding protein that regulates cell proliferation and survival in response to extracellular stimuli, such as activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of T cell receptor (TCR). Originally identified as an oncogene in murine sarcoma viruses, activating mutations in Ras have been found in about 30% of human tumors. Dysregulation of the Ras signaling pathway plays a key role in the progression of cancer. When bound to GTP, Ras is active and stimulates several downstream targets by direct interactions."

### Situation (S): 
At Mayo Clinic's Health Sciences Research lab in Scottasdale, a gradute student wants a website to display his Ras-Signaling project for academic publications. But he is not able to do so because of unfamiliarity with web design. 
### Task (T): 
My goal is to create an interactive website of Ras Signaling that would help the project publication by saving researchers/pubilshers' time to navigate the project instead of reading through the long paper. 
### Action (A): 
I design a new web page to by studying online libraries for web design, such as GOJS, a JavaScript library for implementing custom interactive diagrams and data visualizations (ref. https://gojs.net/latest/index.html). However, it doesn't work well for this project because it requires high-level customization. So I choose to write pure JavaScript code to define various links and nodes. Also, I use PhotoShop to move the links explanation to the top so it shows details by hovering mouse. I update the project once the graduate student has updated data/requirements. To make it easy for the gradute student, I use NodeJS to convert the shared Excel sheets data into JSON data so he can focus on spreadsheets without worring about web design.  
### Result (R):

# The goal of this project is to convert an existing pdf into an interactive websites with dragable and clickable noeds, various types of links and other functionalities.
