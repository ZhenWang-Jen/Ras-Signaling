# Ras-Signaling
"Ras is a monomeric membrane-associated GTP-binding protein that regulates cell proliferation and survival in response to extracellular stimuli, such as activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of T cell receptor (TCR). Originally identified as an oncogene in murine sarcoma viruses, activating mutations in Ras have been found in about 30% of human tumors. Dysregulation of the Ras signaling pathway plays a key role in the progression of cancer. When bound to GTP, Ras is active and stimulates several downstream targets by direct interactions."

### Situation (S): 
At Mayo Clinic's Health Sciences Research lab in Scottasdale, a gradute student works on this Ras-Signaling project as described above. He isn't familiar with web design so he isn't able to develop a website with his academic paper for publications. 
### Task (T): 
My goal was to help the project publication by creating an interactive website of Ras-Signaling with draggable, clickable functionalities and so on. 
##### The goal of this project is to convert an existing pdf into an interactive websites with dragable and clickable noeds, various types of links and other functionalities.
 so researchers/pubilshers can easily navigate the project instead of
Action (A): I designed a new promotional packet to go with the rate sheet and compared the
benefits of The Review circulation with other ad media in the area. I also set-up a special training
session for the account executives with a School of Business Administration professor who
discussed competitive selling strategies.
Result (R): We signed contracts with 15 former advertisers for daily ads and five for special
supplements. We increased our new advertisers by 20 percent over the same period last year.
